    "A Database is nothing but a big storing device that stores our data\n",
    "1. __SQL DB :__ SQL databases, also known as relational databases, use structured query language (SQL) to store and retrieve data. SQL databases are based on a table-based schema, where each table represents a particular entity, such as customers or orders. Each row in the table represents a specific instance of that entity, and each column represents a specific attribute or property of that entity. SQL databases are highly scalable and provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) compliance, making them suitable for handling large and complex transactions.\n",
    "2. __NOSQL DB :__ NOSQL Database use a variety of different data models for storing and accessing data, such as document-based, key-value, graph, and column-family databases. NoSQL databases are often used in applications that require flexible data models, fast access to large volumes of data, and high scalability. Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not use a fixed schema and are often referred to as \"schema-less\". They do not support ACID transactions, but they offer high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance, making them suitable for use in distributed systems and real-time applications."
